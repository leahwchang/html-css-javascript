// $(document).ready(function() {

// Create a basic 3x3 board object in Javascript that lists the current item in each space on the board (e.g. "X", "O", or " ").

// Create a render() function which cycles through that board object and creates the appropriate HTML elements. Style them to look like a real tic-tac-toe board.

// Build the main game logic (we won't give too many hints here). When the user clicks on a blank square, it should show the current player's symbol. This can be triggered by listening for a click event on the appropriate div. It may be helpful to give each div a data attribute or id based on its position so you can identify it in your JS code.

// The game logic should then check whether the game is over -- if any player has achieved victory or if there are no more turns available. In the event of victory or defeat, display an appropriate message on the screen.

// });
